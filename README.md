indentLine
==========

This plugin is used for displaying thin vertical lines at each indentation level for code indented with spaces.
For code indented with tabs, I think there is no need to support it, using :set list lcs=tab:\\|\ (here is a space) can 
achieve it.

## Requirements
This plugin takes advantage of newly provided conceal feature in Vim 7.3, so Vim 7.3 with conceal feature is needed.

## Installation
To install the plugin just copy indentLine.vim into plugin directory.


## Setting custom line colors
For gvim, hi Conceal guifg=(color you like) guibg=NONE

For vim, hi Conceal ctermfg=(color you like) ctermbg=NONE

You can change indentline char by youself.
change this variable:

```vim
let g:indentLine_char = "â”‚"
```
